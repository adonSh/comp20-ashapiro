<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  The "Not Uber" service provides a platform for potential passengers to find
  active vehicles near them and for drivers to locate passengers requesting a
  ride. My job is to find security flaws in the server that might allow a user
  with malicious intent to access privileged data or otherwise compromise
  the application.
  </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
  The first thing I looked for in the server's code was any place where a user
  might be able to enter strings without restriction. This is where I found the
  first XSS vulnerability. Next I tried to see what the server would let me do
  to it before I was either locked out or it gave up. This is how I found out
  that the server would accept input until it failed. Finally, I realized that
  I could also submit unsanitized strings to the /vehicle.json GET route and
  I managed to access parts of the database that I should not have been able
  to access.
  </p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
  <p>
  The server and the client have numerous vulnerabilities. Multiple pages are
  open to attacks involving the insertion of malicious code into either the
  web page or database or both. The database is also quite insecure. I managed
  to access multiple entries in the private vehicles collection without the
  usernames I was meant to have to access them.
  </p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>
  <h3>Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in /submit and Homepage</h3>
    <p>
    Severity: High -- A malicious user could submit just about any code they
    could think of and because it is entered into the database it would be
    persistent. The potential for abuse here is essentially infinite.
    </p><p>
    Using <code>curl</code> I submitted a passenger whose username consisted
    of a snippet of Javascript code. When this passenger's name was rendered
    as HTML and displayed on the index page, the script was automatically
    run. The script I submitted was mostly harmless, only displaying an alert
    window, but a more malicious hacker could have displayed anything they
    pleased on the homepage or done anything from stealing a user's cookies to
    holding deleting the database and holding its contents for ransom. This
    can be prevented by sanitizing input from the user and removing characters
    that can be interpreted as anything other than text by the browser. <br>

    </p>
  <h3>No Submission Restrictions on /submit</h3>
    <p>
    Severity: Medium -- While this vulnerability has the potential to
    completely disable the server, there is no sensitive information at stake.
    It is also somewhat tedious to execute and easy to identify before serious
    damage is caused.
    </p><p>
    I wrote a small bash script to submit passengers to the server one after
    the other in an infinite loop. After running it for a few minutes, the
    server was overwhelmed and became unresponsive. To avoid this, some limit
    should be placed on either the size of the database or on a user's ability
    to submit passengers indiscriminately. <br>

    </p>
  <h3>Database Injection in /vehicle.json</h3>
    <p>
    Severity: Low -- Fortunately, there is no sensitive information in the
    MongoDB collection in question, and an attacker would have to extract each
    document one at a time anyway. This is still a serious issue with no small
    potential for abuse.
    </p><p>
    By adding some MongoDB commands to the query string attached to
    /vehicle.json I was able to access contents of the collection without
    knowing a username. For example, the query string "username[$ne]=anything"
    matches any entry in the database whose username is not "anything," causing
    the page to display documents that the user should not be able to access
    without first knowing the proper username. Again this could be easily fixed
    by sanitizing inputs. <br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
  The integrity of the application as it stands is easily compromised. However,
  most of the problems are easily remedied. From now on, never trust user
  input, and always sanitize strings submitted by users, especially if they
  will later be rendered in HTML. The main lesson to be learned here is to
  never allow users to do anything without restriction, whether it's the data
  they submit or even how often they do it.
