#This repository contains all my labs and assignments for COMP20

My favorite assignment was Assignment 3. It was really neat to see how all the
parts fit together form the previous assignment and to get a sort of overhead
view of the client-server process.

I think I've grown a little in that I realized that you don't have to know
everything about a tool to use it. If you can understand it's function and how
to get it to do what you need, then most of the time that's good enough and
will help you get where you want quicker.

In the same vein, I think the most important thing I learned in this course is
that the web is really a mess and you can't possibly understand it all. For
example, all the myriad tools and stacks that essentially do the same thing
(e.g. LAMP, node + mongo, python, ruby on rails, many databases, etc.), and
just the incredible abstraction of it all. There's so many small parts that fit
together to make a truly giant system so far removed from the more low-level
programming that I'm used to.

I was really intrigued by some of the features of javascript, and I'd like to
delve a little more into Programming Languages.
